# 🌟 Emotion Detection Application 🌟

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an AI-based web application that analyzes customer feedback for an e-commerce company. The application utilizes the Watson NLP library to perform emotion detection, identifying emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more from customer feedback text.

## 📖 Introduction
