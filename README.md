# Emotion Detection Application👨‍💻

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an AI-based web application that analyzes customer feedback for an e-commerce company. The application utilizes the Watson NLP library to perform emotion detection, identifying emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more from customer feedback text.

## 📖 Introduction
Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting specific emotions from statements rather than just their polarity. This makes emotion detection a crucial branch of study, widely used by businesses in AI-driven recommendation systems and automated chatbots.
